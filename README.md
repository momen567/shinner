# ‚ùì Features

**Destroy Account**  
Removes all friends and leaves every server.  

**View account information**  
Fetches basic account information, such as username, user ID, email, phone number, and payment information if there is.  

**Crash Client**  
Essentially spam-switches themes and language to lag/crash anyone who is using that account's client.  
  
  
# üìù Installation
First, you need to download chromedriver.exe and put it in the same folder as the tool. You can find it [here.](https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads)  
Before using the tool, run `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install the required dependencies.  
After that, simply run the tool using `python3 shinner.py`  
  
If you're using the release version, just make sure chromedriver.exe is in the same folder as the tool.

# üñ§ Support
First, open an issue on the repo. If I don't get back to you in 24 hours, then [join my Discord](https://madebyzuoa.github.io/discord) for support. You should only ask for help if you have an issue with the tool itself and not your PC. If you don't know how to use a command line and python, you shouldn't be using my tool.
